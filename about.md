Hi, I am **vdnamliv** - a security engineer focusing on red teaming. This blog keeps:

- Sketchy Walkthrough HackTheBox
- Not-good write-up CTFs
- Short checklists and scripts that save minutes (sometimes not)

I also mentor a few students on basic security, computer network and competitive programing. Reach out if you want to collaborate or swap stories.
