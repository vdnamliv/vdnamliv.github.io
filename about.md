Hi, I am **vdnamliv** - a security engineer focusing on red teaming and incident response. This Jekyll blog keeps:

- Step-by-step HackTheBox notes
- Battle-tested tactics from regional CTFs
- Short checklists and scripts that save minutes during investigations

I also mentor a few student teams on offensive security. Reach out if you want to collaborate or swap stories.
